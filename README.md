# stats-preview-card-component
This is Frontend Mentor's challenge.

Used TailwindCSS for this project because I wanted to practice it.
Had some problems about responsive design because I am not yet so
skilled in TailwindCSS.

Somehow managed to finish this one.
I know it is not perfect but also think it is good enough.
